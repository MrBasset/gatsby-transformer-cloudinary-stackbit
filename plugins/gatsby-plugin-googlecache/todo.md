## To Do List

[ ] change the upload and download to package everything into a single tar. If a file is changed locally, just edit the tar and then re-upload.

[ ] Amend the code so that we aren't totally recreating the tar, but instead we are adding/updating/deleting files as appropriate and then pushing the tar file up to google.
